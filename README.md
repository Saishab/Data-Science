# Data - Science with R :  Project 1

This Project deals with Supervised Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression. We are provided with a dataset consisting of 3 instances of a Person's behavior on Smoking, Biking, and Heart Disease. The dataset contains observations on the percentage of people biking to work each day, the percentage of people smoking, and the percentage of people with heart disease. With this project we are trying to answer the following questions :

1. What Linear Regression is all about
2.MultiCollinearity in Regression
3.Outliers in Dataset.
4.Dependencies of Dependent Variables in Independent Variables and effect of these independent variables in dependent.
